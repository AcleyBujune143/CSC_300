About: Linked lists - CSC 250 Review
Date: Sep 11, 2024
Comments: Includes three files -> ll.h, main.cpp, ll.cpp

*** I did change the insertNode function to a doubly linked list function for the extra credit on ll.cpp

*** FIRST OPEN THE FOLDER WHERE THESE THREE FILES ARE LOCATED:
    In command prompt:
        cd folder-containing-the-files
        code .
*** 
To compile: g++ main.cpp ll.cpp
To run: ./a 

OR

To compile: g++ main.cpp ll.cpp -o whatevernameyoulike
To run: ./whatevernameyoulike
